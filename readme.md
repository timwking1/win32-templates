# win32-templates

These are the skeleton templates I use for Win32 API C applications based on examples from *Programming Windows* by Charles Petzold. The template creates a minimal window, displays it, and processes a message loop.

Provided are examples supporting both ANSI narrow strings and UNICODE wide strings.
They are both readily built with gcc provided the correct compiler flags.
